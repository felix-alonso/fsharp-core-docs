# F# Core Library Documentation

This site contains the documentation for the FSharp.Core library used in all F# code.

FSharp.Core contains functionality for basic F# definitions, operations for collections such as lists, maps and sequences,
and library functionality for quotations, reflections, events, asynchronous programming and native interoperability.

The following namespaces are available:

* [FSharp.Core](reference/fsharp-core.html) - Basic definitions of options, functions, operators, results and formatting.

* [FSharp.Collections](reference/fsharp-collections.html) - Operations for collections such as lists, arrays, sets, maps and sequences. See also [F# Collection Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/fsharp-collection-types) in the F# Language Guide.

* [FSharp.Control](reference/fsharp-control.html) - Library functionality for asynchronous programming, events and agents. See also [F# Asynchronous Programming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/async-expressions) in the F# Language Guide.

* [FSharp.Linq](reference/fsharp-linq.html) - Library functionality for F# query syntax and interoperability with .NET Expressions. See also [F# Query Expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/query-expressions) in the F# Language Guide.

* [FSharp.Quotations](reference/fsharp-quotations.html) - Library functionality for F# quotations. See also [F# Code Quotations](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/code-quotations) in the F# Language Guide.

* [FSharp.Reflection](reference/fsharp-reflection.html) - Library functionality for accessing additional information about F# types and F# values at runtime, augmenting that available through [System.Reflection](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.reflection). See also [F# Reflection](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/F_Sharp_Programming/Reflection) in the F# Wiki Book.  

* [FSharp.NativeInterop](reference/fsharp-nativeinterop.html) - Basic functionality for native interopability. See also [F# External Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/functions/external-functions) in the F# Language Guide. 

* [FSharp.Core.CompilerServices](reference/fsharp-core-compilerservices.html) - Library functionality for supporting type providers and code generated by the F# compiler. See also [F# Type Providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tutorials/type-providers/) in the F# Language Guide.
